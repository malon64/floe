# Changelog

All notable changes to Floe are documented in this file.

- Split the entity runner into focused modules and centralized warning handling.
- Added configurable row error formatting (json/csv/text) in reports.
- Unified input resolution logic and reorganized run/config tests.
- Improved warn-mode performance and added lazy scan paths for CSV/Parquet.
- Added benchmark harness docs/scripts and example reports for v0.1.5.

## v0.1.4

- Expanded input format scaffolding (Parquet/JSON readers) and IO dispatch.
- Run pipeline refactor to use format adapters and shared IO helpers.

## v0.1.2

- Config validation now rejects unknown fields and adds broader negative test coverage.

- Release pipeline hardening: portable version bumping, allow-dirty publish, and tap checkout fixes.

## v0.1.1

- Global report layout with run-scoped directories and per-entity reports.
- CI/CD release pipeline (crate publish, binaries, checksums, GitHub Release, Homebrew tap).

## v0.1.0

- Initial CLI (`validate`, `run`) and YAML configuration schema.

- Core checks: casting, not-null, unique; row-level rejection and run reports.
- Multi-entity support with run-scoped reporting.
