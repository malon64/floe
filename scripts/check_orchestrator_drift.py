"""Fail when designated shared orchestrator modules drift out of lockstep.

The ``dagster-floe`` and ``airflow-floe`` packages each vendor a copy of a few
modules that are meant to stay byte-identical (see issue #394). They are
published as independent PyPI packages with no shared runtime dependency, so the
copies can silently diverge — and historically did. This guard compares each
designated pair and exits non-zero on any difference, turning drift into a
red CI check instead of a latent production bug.

Run locally with::

    python scripts/check_orchestrator_drift.py

Only modules that are intended to be identical belong here. ``manifest.py`` and
the ``*_runner.py`` modules are intentionally framework-specific and are NOT
guarded.
