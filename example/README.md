# Floe — hands-on example

This directory is a self-contained tutorial. You can run the full pipeline in under a minute using only the files already here.

## What this example covers

| Entity | Input | Sink | Key features demonstrated |
|---|---|---|---|
| `customer` | CSV files | Delta Lake | `strict` casting · `reject` severity · `unique` constraint · incremental state |
| `orders` | JSON files (nested) | Parquet | Nested field selectors · `warn` severity · `fill_nulls` mismatch policy |

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Verify floe is installed
floe --version
```

→ [Install floe](../docs/installation.md) if needed.

---

## Run it

```bash
# From the repo root
cd example

# 1. Validate the config (no data moved)
floe validate -c config.yml

# 2. Run the pipeline
floe run -c config.yml

# 3. Inspect the report
cat report/*/run.summary.json | head -40
```

    └── customer.json      ← tracks which CSV files were already ingested
```

Rows that pass all checks go to `out/accepted/`. Rows that fail go to `out/rejected/` with two extra columns: `__floe_row_index` (original row number) and `__floe_errors` (JSON array of error messages).

## Config walkthrough

### Global settings

```yaml
version: "0.1"

report:
  path: "./report"          # run reports land here
```

### Entity: `customer`

```yaml
- name: "customer"
  incremental_mode: "file"  # skip files already processed on re-run
  state:
    path: "./state/customer.json"
```

**`incremental_mode: file`** — floe records which source files it has processed in `state/customer.json`. Re-running with the same inputs is a no-op. Drop a new CSV file and floe picks it up.

```yaml
  source:
    format: "csv"
    path: "./in/customer"
    options:
      header: true
      null_values: ["", "NULL", "null"]
      glob: "*.csv"           # pick up all CSV files in the directory
    cast_mode: "strict"       # reject the whole row if a type cast fails
```

```yaml
  sink:
    accepted:
      format: "delta"         # writes a Delta Lake table
      path: "./out/accepted/customer_delta/"
    rejected:
      format: "csv"
      path: "./out/rejected/customer/"
```

```yaml
  policy:
    severity: "reject"        # rows failing checks go to rejected sink
                              # warn  → flag but keep in accepted
                              # abort → stop the run entirely
```

```yaml
  schema:
    mismatch:
      missing_columns: "reject_file"  # reject the whole file if expected columns are absent
      extra_columns: "ignore"
    normalize_columns:
      enabled: true
      strategy: "snake_case"   # rename source columns to snake_case automatically

    columns:
      - name: "customer_id"
        type: "string"
        nullable: false
        unique: true            # duplicate customer_ids across all accepted rows → rejected
      - name: "email"
        type: "string"
        nullable: true
        unique: true
```

### Entity: `orders`

```yaml
- name: "orders"
  source:
    format: "json"
    path: "./in/orders"
    options:
      json_mode: "array"      # input files are JSON arrays (not NDJSON)
    cast_mode: "strict"
```

Nested field selectors — extract deep values from the JSON structure using dot notation and array indexes:

```yaml
    columns:
      - name: "order_id"
        source: "order.id"         # → {"order": {"id": "..."}}
      - name: "order_total"
        source: "totals.amount"    # → {"totals": {"amount": 99.9}}
      - name: "first_item_sku"
        source: "items[0].sku"     # → {"items": [{"sku": "..."}]}
```

```yaml
  policy:
    severity: "warn"          # invalid rows logged but kept in accepted output
                              # run still exits 0
  schema:
    mismatch:
      missing_columns: "fill_nulls"   # missing columns are added as nulls (no file rejection)
```

---

## Try breaking it

**See rejections in action:**
```bash
# Add a duplicate customer_id to customers_valid.csv and re-run
# (delete state/customer.json first to force reprocessing)
rm -f state/customer.json
floe run -c config.yml
cat out/rejected/customer/part-*.csv
```

**See incremental state skip files:**
```bash
floe run -c config.yml      # first run processes all files
floe run -c config.yml      # second run: "0 files pending" — all already processed
```

**See a missing-column file rejection:**

`in/customer/customers_missing.csv` already has a column that does not match the schema. After running, check `out/rejected/customer/` — the whole file's rows are routed there.

## Profiles (environment overrides)

The `profiles/` directory shows how to override config values per environment without duplicating the full config:

```bash
floe run -c config.yml --profile profiles/prod.yml
```
