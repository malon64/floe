"""Copy the canonical manifest schema into the package before building.

dagster-floe validates every manifest against a bundled copy of
``orchestrators/schemas/floe.manifest.v1.json`` (loaded via
``importlib.resources``, see ``floe_dagster/manifest.py``) so it never needs
a runtime dependency on floe-core. That copy previously had to be kept in
sync by hand and silently drifted (issue #446): this refreshes it from the
canonical source on every build (`pip install -e .`, `pip install .`,
`python -m build`), so a stale vendored copy can no longer reach a release.

`scripts/check_orchestrator_drift.py` still checks the checked-in vendored
copy against canonical in CI - that guards the source tree itself (e.g. for
test runs against `src/` directly, which never invoke this file), while this
guards what actually gets published.
