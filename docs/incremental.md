# Incremental File Ingestion

Floe's file incremental mode tracks source files that already passed through an
entity. Later runs skip those files, process only new files, and keep enough
state to avoid duplicate work when multiple runners overlap.

Use this when a source directory or object-storage prefix receives new files
over time, for example daily partner drops, API exports, or landing-zone batches.

## Enable File Incremental Mode

Set `incremental_mode: file` on the entity:

```yaml
entities:
  - name: orders
    incremental_mode: file
    source:
      format: csv
      path: s3://raw-bucket/incoming/orders/
    sink:
      write_mode: append
      accepted:
        format: delta
        path: s3://lake-bucket/bronze/orders/
      rejected:
        format: parquet
        path: s3://lake-bucket/rejected/orders/
    policy:
      severity: reject
    schema:
      columns:
        - name: order_id
          type: string
          nullable: false
```

If `state.path` is omitted, Floe derives the state object under the source root:

```text
<source root>/.floe/state/<entity>/state.json
```

For the example above, the default state URI is:

```text
s3://raw-bucket/incoming/orders/.floe/state/orders/state.json
```

## Override The State Path

Use `state.path` when you want state stored separately from the input prefix:

```yaml
entities:
  - name: orders
    incremental_mode: file
    state:
      path: s3://ops-bucket/floe-state/orders/state.json
    source:
      format: csv
      path: s3://raw-bucket/incoming/orders/
```

Only explicit cloud URIs (`s3://`, `gs://`, `abfs://`, `abfss://`) create remote
state. Relative `state.path` values are local filesystem paths, even when the
source is remote.

## Inspect State

Use `floe state inspect` to see the resolved state URI and current JSON:

```bash
floe state inspect -c config.yml --entity orders
```

This is useful before or after a run to confirm:

- where Floe stores incremental state
- how many files have already been processed
- whether another run currently has active claims

## Reset State

Use `floe state reset` to remove the state object:

```bash
floe state reset -c config.yml --entity orders --yes
```

The next run treats matching source files as new again. Remote resets use a
conditional delete so Floe fails if another process changes state while the
reset is running.

## State File Shape

File incremental state uses schema `floe.state.file-ingest.v2`:

```json
{
  "schema": "floe.state.file-ingest.v2",
  "entity": "orders",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-23T09:00:00Z",
  "files": {
    "s3://raw-bucket/incoming/orders/orders_001.csv": {
      "processed_at": "2026-06-23T09:00:00Z",
      "size": 18422,
      "mtime": "2026-06-23T08:45:00Z"
    }
  },
  "claims": {
    "s3://raw-bucket/incoming/orders/orders_002.csv": {
      "run_id": "2026-06-23T09-10-00Z",
      "acquired_at": "2026-06-23T09:10:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2026-06-23T10:10:00Z",
      "size": 20114,
      "mtime": "2026-06-23T09:05:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The `files` map is durable history: source URIs that finished successfully. The
`claims` map is temporary ownership: source URIs currently reserved by a run.

Existing `floe.state.file-ingest.v1` files are still readable. Floe upgrades
them to v2 the next time it writes state.

## Run Behavior

At the start of an entity run, Floe:

1. Loads the state file or creates an empty state.
2. Removes expired claims.
3. Skips files already present in `files`.
4. Skips files with active claims from another run and emits an incremental warning.
5. Claims remaining pending files before accepted sink output is written.

When the entity finishes successfully, Floe promotes this run's claims into the
`files` map with observed size and mtime. If the entity fails or aborts, Floe
releases this run's claims so the same files can be retried later.

If a file URI is already in `files` but its size or mtime changed, Floe emits an
`incremental_file_changed` warning and still skips it. The URI is the identity;
Floe does not automatically reprocess changed files.

## CAS And Concurrent Runs

Remote state uses compare-and-swap (CAS) writes so two runners cannot silently
overwrite each other's state:

- S3 and ADLS use object ETags through conditional writes.
- GCS uses object generation numbers through conditional writes.
- Local state uses a local file version check with a local file lock.

Every state mutation is written only if the version read by the runner is still
current. If another runner wins the race, Floe reloads state, backs off, and
retries. After repeated conflicts, the run fails with a clear incremental state
conflict error.

Claims expire after one hour. A background heartbeat renews active claims during
long-running processes so normal long runs keep ownership. If a process crashes,
its claims eventually expire and another run can pick those files up.

## Permissions

Remote incremental state needs permission to:

- read the state object
- create or update it with conditional preconditions
- delete it conditionally for `state reset`

The source still needs its normal list/read permissions. The state object itself
does not require listing except where the selected cloud provider or IAM policy
requires it for object access.
