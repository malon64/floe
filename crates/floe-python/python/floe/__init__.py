# DuckDB sinks compile a bundled native build that is too large for PyPI, so the

# `floe-duckdb` wheel that installs a `floe._floe_duckdb` companion extension into
# this same package. When a run targets a DuckDB sink and this is the lean build,
# `run` transparently delegates to that companion, mirroring the lean `floe` CLI
# re-execing the `floe-duckdb` binary. Install instructions for the companion:
# `--index-url` (not `--extra-index-url`) so pip resolves the `floe-duckdb`
# name ONLY from the off-PyPI index: `floe-duckdb` is intentionally absent from
# PyPI, and `--extra-index-url` would leave PyPI in play, letting a squatted /
# higher-version `floe-duckdb` there shadow the real companion (dependency
# confusion). The companion's `floe-python` dependency is already satisfied
# here — this hint only fires from an installed lean `floe` — so replacing PyPI
# for this single install does not break dependency resolution.
